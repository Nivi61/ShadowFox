Task - 2

Sentiment analysis helps in finding the emotional tone of a sentence. It helps businesses, researchers and developers to understand opinions and sentiments expressed in text data which is important for applications like social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis and more.
X is among the social media platforms where individuals freely express their views on various subjects. Occasionally, we witness intense debates on X regarding someone's stance, leading to an accumulation of negative posts.

This project performs sentiment and topic analysis on 16,000+ X (Twitter) statements to understand public opinion trends. The dataset includes pre-labeled sentiment values (-1, 0, 1), which were analyzed and visualized to extract meaningful insights.

The project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques to explore patterns in sentiment across different topics such as Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment, and Business

Implemented keyword-based topic categorization

Topics: Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment, Business, Other

Statistical Analysis

Sentiment distribution analysis

Crosstab analysis (Topic vs Sentiment)

Frequency analysis of negative words

Visualization
